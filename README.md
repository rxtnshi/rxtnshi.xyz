This website is hosted via GitHub pages and its template can be found [here](https://github.com/yousinix/portfolYOU)!

## I want a website like this!

As mentioned above, the template used is an open-source Jeykll portfolio that works with GitHub pages. Requirements needed:

- [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/) (v2.7.0 or higher)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation)
- [Bundler](https://bundler.io) (modern versions of Ruby should come with Bundler preinstalled)

You can then grab the template by visiting the link I put above and follow the directions on how to test out your website [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)!
